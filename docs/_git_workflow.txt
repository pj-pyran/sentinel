1. Make changes locally
    Work in dev
        git switch dev

    Commit as usual
        git add .
        git commit -m "Whatever you changed"

2. Push updates to remote dev
        git push origin dev
    This syncs your work to GitHub but doesn’t affect main.

3. Create Pull Request (dev → main)
    On GitHub:
        a. Open PR from dev into main
        b. Write a quick summary if needed
        c. Merge when ready (no approval required since you're the lone wolf)
        This is the moment that remote main is updated - nowhere else.

4. Sync your local main after merge
        git switch main && git pull origin main
    Your local main is now in lockstep with the remote protected main.

5. Keep dev updated (optional but tidy)
        git switch dev && git merge main && git push origin dev && git status
    (or git rebase main if you like clean history, then git push origin dev --force)

This stops your dev branch diverging over time and keeps remote dev in sync.

Quick cheat-sheet version
    dev → commit → push origin dev → PR → merge → switch to main → pull → switch to dev → merge main → push origin dev → keep going
