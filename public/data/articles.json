The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters: Just yesterday [the White House team] had very good talks with the Ukrainians in Florida and now of course special envoy Witkoff is on his way to Russia.\u201d Witkoff has in the past returned to Washington conveying variations of Vladimir Putin\u2019s maximalist demands for Ukraine\u2019s total capitulation.
