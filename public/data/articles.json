Nine blazes remained out of control on Monday as flames ripped through homes and critical infrastructure. Scorching temperatures \u2013 peaking at 41C in Koolewong \u2013 combined with fierce, erratic winds to spread the fires rapidly and made them harder to control.</p><p>On Sunday night an Australian firefighter was killed after a tree fell on him while he worked on a fire near Bulahdelah, about 150 miles (250km) north of Sydney. The blaze scorched 3,500 hectares (8,600 acres) and destroyed four homes over the weekend. NSW, one of Australia\u2019s most fire-prone regions, is particularly vulnerable because of its hot, dry climate and vast eucalyptus forests, which shed oils that become highly flammable.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/12/weather-tracker-australia-bushfires-most-dangerous-since-black-summer\">Continue reading...</a>",
