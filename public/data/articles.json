However, limited available open geospatial data made it challenging to inform disaster response and recovery efforts. In a fast-paced effort to gather the missing data through OpenStreetMap (OSM), HOT collaborated with the Myanmar OpenStreetMap Community (myOSM), the Centre for Development and Environment of the University of Bern, the Myanmar Branch Office (CDE Myanmar), and more than 3,000 global volunteers to add more than 1 million buildings \ud83c\udfe1 and almost 15,000 KM of roads \ud83d\udee3\ufe0f, allowing humanitarian actors to have a more complete view of which areas needed attention.",
